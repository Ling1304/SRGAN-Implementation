# SRGAN-Implementation
This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of the paper Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network, authored by Christian Ledig, Lucas Theis, Ferenc Husz√°r, Jose Caballero, Andrew Cunningham, Alejandro Acosta, Andrew Aitken, Alykhan Tejani, Johannes Totz, Zehan Wang, and Wenzhe Shi. The paper introduces the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce photo-realistic high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs.
